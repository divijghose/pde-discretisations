## 1D Advection Equation with Periodic B.C.s

We consider the PDE
$$
\begin{cases}
u_t + a u_x = 0, \\
u(x,0) = \varphi(x), \\
u(L,t) = u(0,t).
\end{cases}
$$

One can readily check that
$$
u(x,t) = \varphi(x - at)
$$
is a solution, provided $\varphi$ is sufficiently regular.

## Backward Euler–Centered Method

This is a finite difference method. We approximate
$$
u_m^n \approx u(m\Delta x,\, n\Delta t),
$$
with spatial step
$$
\Delta x = \frac{L}{M}, \quad m = 0,\dots, M-1,
$$
and time levels $n = 0,1,2,\dots$

Note that periodic boundary conditions are enforced by identifying indices modulo $M$:
$$
 u_M^n = u_0^n.
$$
Since we only store indices up to $0, \dots, M-1$, this is already dealt with in the discretized equation.

### Discretisation

We use:

**Time discretisation:**
$$
u_t \approx \frac{u_m^{n+1} - u_m^n}{\Delta t}.
$$

**Centered difference(space one timestep ahead, implicit):**
$$
u_x \approx \frac{u_{m+1}^{\,n+1} - u_{m-1}^{\,n+1}}{2\Delta x}.
$$

Substituting into the PDE $u_t + a u_x = 0$ gives
$$
\frac{u_m^{n+1} - u_m^n}{\Delta t}
+ a \frac{u_{m+1}^{\,n+1} - u_{m-1}^{\,n+1}}{2\Delta x}
= 0.
$$

Multiplying through by $\Delta t$:
$$
u_m^{n+1} - u_m^n
+ \frac{a\Delta t}{2\Delta x}
\left(u_{m+1}^{\,n+1} - u_{m-1}^{\,n+1}\right)
= 0.
$$

Let the Courant number be
$$
c = \frac{a\Delta t}{\Delta x}.
$$

We arrive at the implicit scheme
$$
u_m^{n+1}
+ \frac{c}{2}\left(u_{m+1}^{\,n+1} - u_{m-1}^{\,n+1}\right)
= u_m^n.
$$

### Consistency Analysis

Really this comes down to the fact that the centered difference formula is of second order. For fixed $t$, we have by Taylor's formula, for each we have 

Using Taylor expansion in space (at fixed time), we write
$$
u(x + \Delta x, \cdot)
= u(x, \cdot)
+ \Delta x\, u_x
+ \frac{(\Delta x)^2}{2} u_{xx}
+ \frac{(\Delta x)^3}{6} u_{xxx}
+ \cdots,
$$

and similarly
$$
u(x - \Delta x, \cdot)
= u(x, \cdot)
- \Delta x\, u_x
+ \frac{(\Delta x)^2}{2} u_{xx}
- \frac{(\Delta x)^3}{6} u_{xxx}
+ \cdots.
$$


Some rearranging gives 

$$2\Delta x\, u_x = u(x+\Delta x,\cdot) - u(x-\Delta x,\cdot) + \frac{2(\Delta x)^3}{6} u_{xxx}
+ \cdots $$

Dividing by $2\Delta x$,
$$
u_x  = \frac{u(x+\Delta x,\cdot) - u(x-\Delta x,\cdot)}{2\Delta x}
+  \mathcal{O}((\Delta x)^2).
$$

We see the leading truncation error is of order $(\Delta x)^2$, an order better than standard forward-backward methods.


Let $u(x, t)$ solve $u_t + au_x=0$ and set $u_m^n = u(m \Delta x, n \Delta t)$. Define the residual as

$$
\tau_m^n := \left| u_t(m \Delta x, n \Delta t) + a\, u_x(m \Delta x, n \Delta t) - 
\left( \frac{u_m^{\,n+1} - u_m^n}{\Delta t} 
+ a\, \frac{u_{m+1}^{\,n+1} - u_{m-1}^{\,n+1}}{2 \Delta x} \right) \right|.
$$

By the triangle inequality, we can bound

$$
\tau_m^n \le \left| u_t(m \Delta x, n \Delta t) - \frac{u_m^{\,n+1} - u_m^n}{\Delta t} \right|
+ a \left| u_x(m \Delta x, (n+1) \Delta t) - \frac{u_{m+1}^{\,n+1} - u_{m-1}^{\,n+1}}{2 \Delta x} \right|.
$$

Taylor in time and our above centered difference approximation:
$$
\frac{u_m^{\,n+1} - u_m^n}{\Delta t} = u_t(m \Delta x, n \Delta t) + \mathcal{O}(\Delta t), \qquad
\frac{u_{m+1}^{\,n+1} - u_{m-1}^{\,n+1}}{2 \Delta x} = u_x(m \Delta x, (n+1) \Delta t) + \mathcal{O}((\Delta x)^2) + \mathcal{O}(\Delta t).
$$

and therefore the residual satisfies

$$
\tau_m^n = \mathcal{O}(\Delta t) + \mathcal{O}((\Delta x)^2).
$$

Hence, as $\Delta t, \Delta x \to 0$, the **Backward Euler–Centered scheme is consistent** with the 1D advection equation, with first-order accuracy in time and second-order accuracy in space.
